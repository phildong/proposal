\section*{Specific Aims}

Understanding how memories experienced across large time scales are associated
together is crucial to understanding episodic memories, since the ability to
relate episodes across days is essential to the formation of memory. Recently it
has been demonstrated in rodents that two neutral contexts experienced close in
time shared a larger proportion of neural ensemble than those experienced more
distant in time. Furthermore, subsequent fear conditioning in the second context
increased animals' freezing level in the first context, suggesting a transfer of
fear memory retrospectively \cite{cai_shared_2016}. These results suggest that
memories that have a small temporal distance can be linked together. However, it
remains unclear what factors may affect the temporal window of memory linking.
Specifically, it is unknown whether the affective value of a memory influences
the extent or the symmetry of the temporal window of memory linking. For
instance, it is unclear whether negative valence of a memory could extend the
time window within which it may be linked to a previous memory. Moreover, it is
not clear whether a negative memory could link forward with a memory that
happens later in time, and whether such prospective memory linking has a similar
time window as retrospective memory linking (\textit{i.e} whether the time
window is symmetric regarding the temporal order of memories). Thus, the main
goal of this proposal is to study how affective value and temporal order affect
the time window of memory linking, with both behavioral experiments and calcium
imaging in behaving animals.

It has been shown that two neutral contexts can be linked together when they are
separated by 5 hours, but not when they are separated by 2 days. We have
preliminary results suggesting that negative-valued context can be linked with a
neutral context 2 days ago, and they have larger proportion of overlapping
ensemble cells comparing to two neutral contexts. Thus, our first hypothesis is
that negative emotional value extend the temporal window of memory linking
retrospectively. On the other hand, we have preliminary results showing that a
negative-valued context can link both backward and forward with a neutral
context across 5 hours time interval, but can only link backward, but not
forward, across 1 day and 2 days interval. Thus, our second hypothesis is that
negative-valued memory have a longer retrospective memory linking window
compared to prospective linking window. To test these hypothesis, we will carry
out behavior experiments utilizing contextual fear conditioning, as well as
\textit{in vivo} calcium imaging in freely moving animals.

In addition, the analysis of neural dynamic in memory linking experiments have
been limited to comparing the number of overlapping active ensemble cells across
different sessions. Although such analysis provided a strong correlate of
behavior results, it reduces time dimension to a binary, all-or-none
representation, thus precluding the possibility of understanding the temporal
structure of ensemble as well as the evolving nature of population coding within
session. By applying dimension reduction analysis such as principal component
analysis (PCA), we can uncover the underlying structures of neural ensembles for
individual sessions and compare their similarities across linking memories
versus non-linking memories. Our hypothesis is that the linked memories have
higher similarities in ensemble structures compared to non-linked memories. To
test this hypothesis, we can apply PCA analysis to calcium traces recorded at
different behavior sessions. The resulting principal components can be thought
of as subset of cells that exhibit highly correlated firing. We can then
calculate a correlation of the components across different sessions, and compare
the correlation between linking contexts with those between non-linking
contexts. We predict that the correlation of structured ensemble components are
higher for linking contexts comparing to non-linking contexts.

\paragraph{Aim 1: Study the effect of emotional value on the extent and symmetry
  of the temporal window of memory linking.} Test the hypothesis that negative
emotional value extend retrospective memory linking time window, and that
retrospective memory linking time window is longer than those in prospective
memory linking.

\paragraph{Aim 2: Study the neuronal correlate of memory linking.} Test the
hypothesis that linked memories have larger neural ensemble overlaps, and that
linked memories also has more similarities in ensemble structures.
