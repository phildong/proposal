\section*{Specific Aims}

Understanding how memories experienced across large time scales are associated
together is crucial to understanding episodic memories, since the ability to
relate episodes across days is essential to the formation of memory. Recently it
has been demonstrated in rodents that two neutral contexts experienced close in
time shared a larger proportion of neural ensemble than those experienced more
distant in time. Furthermore, subsequent fear conditioning in the later context
increased animals' freezing level in the previous context, suggesting a transfer
of fear memory retrospectively \cite{cai_shared_2016}. Such results suggest a
linking of two temporally distinct memories through overlapping neuronal
ensembles, and the phenomenon is termed memory linking. However, it remains
unclear what factors may affect the temporal window of memory linking, which is
the maximum time interval within which two memories can be linked together.
Specifically, it is unknown whether the affective valence of a memory influences
the extent or the symmetry of the temporal window of memory linking. For
instance, it is unclear whether negative valence of a memory could extend the
time window within which it may be linked to a previous memory. Moreover, it is
not clear whether a negative memory could link forward with a memory that
happens later in time, (\textit{i.e} linking to a memory prospectively).
Furthermore, it's unclear whether such prospective memory linking has a similar
time window as retrospective memory linking (\textit{i.e} whether the time
window is symmetric regarding the temporal order of memories). Thus, the main
goal of this proposal is to study how affective value and temporal order affect
the temporal window of memory linking, with both behavioral experiments and
calcium imaging in behaving animals.

Two models have been developed to explain the memory linking phenomenon from two
perspective: the excitability hypothesis from cellular level and temporal
context model from computational level. For a negative memory, both model would
predict a stronger prospective memory linking than retrospective memory linking.
At the same time, neither model would readily expect a change of retrospective
memory linking window as a function of emotional valence. However, from an
ethological point of view, retrospective memory linking is more important than
prospective memory linking, since past memories may have a causal contribution
to future events, but not the other way around. Moreover, memory linking of more
negative events should extend further back in time, since that helps animals to
gather more information to avoid future traumatic events. Thus, we hypothesis
that negative emotional valence extend retrospective memory linking time window,
and that retrospective memory linking time window is longer than those in
prospective memory linking. To test these hypothesis, we will carry out behavior
experiments utilizing contextual fear conditioning, as well as \textit{in vivo}
calcium imaging in freely moving animals.

Besides behavior, the other defining feature of memory linking is an increase of
overlaps between the ensembles of two linked memories. Thus, our second goal is
to study the neural correlates of memory linking during the manipulation of
emotional valence and temporal order of contexts. We hypothesize that if the
temporal window of memory linking changed, and transfer of fear is observed
between two contexts, the overlaps between the ensembles encoding the two
contexts should also increase. In addition, by applying dimension reduction
analysis such as principal component analysis (PCA), we can uncover the
underlying temporal structures of neural ensembles for individual sessions. Thus
we also hypothesize that the similarities between principal components of two
ensembles are higher if the corresponding contexts are linked together. In other
words, the similarities between principal components of two memory ensembles
should be consistent with the overlaps between the two ensembles.

\paragraph{Aim 1: Study the effect of emotional value on the extent and symmetry
  of the temporal window of memory linking.} Test the hypothesis that negative
emotional value extend retrospective memory linking time window, and that
retrospective memory linking time window is longer than those in prospective
memory linking.

\paragraph{Aim 2: Study the neuronal correlate of memory linking.} Test the
hypothesis that linked memories have larger neural ensemble overlaps, and that
linked memories also has more similarities in ensemble structures.
