\section*{A. Significance}

Understanding how temporally distinct memories can be related together is
essential to understanding episodic memory. It is generally believed that
hippocampus make an important contribution to episodic memory in rodents.
Traditionally, studies have focused on how familiar environments are coded in
hippocampus. Most notably, we have extensive knowledge of how space is coded in
distinct familiar settings, as well as how time is coded in learned task
contingencies. On the other hand, it is found that different population of
hippocampal neurons are engaged in memories at different times, forming a
neuronal ensemble of the memory, and artificially stimulating a specific
ensemble can create a ``false'' memory. Moreover, it has been shown that neural
ensembles of same environments overlap in a time-dependent manner, in that
ensembles of two memories happened closer in time share more neurons than those
happened further apart in time, and the shared neurons could potentially
maintain a stable representation of the environment. However, it was unclear
whether overlaps of ensembles encoding different contexts have a similar
time-dependent property, and whether such difference in overlaps have any
behavior correlates.

Recently, it has been found in rodent hippocampus that the neuronal ensembles of
two distinct contextual memories separated by 5 hours time interval has more
overlapping cells than those separated by 2 days or 7 days. Interestingly,
subsequent fear conditioning in the later context induce elevated freezing level
in the former context when the two contexts are separated by 5 hours, indicating
a transfer of fear memory from the second context to the first. Such results
suggest a linking of two temporally distinct memories through overlapping
neuronal ensembles. Following these findings, two models have been proposed to
explain the phenomenon of memory linking: On cellular and circuit level, It has
been hypothesized that memory linking happens through excitability mechanism,
where the ensemble neurons of first memory sustain an elevated excitability
during the memory linking time window, and thus are more likely to be recruited
during the encoding of the second memory, facilitating the linking of the two
memory; At the same time, from a conceptual and computational aspect, temporal
context model suggests that memory linking is a peculiar case of a more general
temporal context framework, which argues that features of memories are
associated with an ever-drifting temporal context, and all recollection of
episodic memories, as well as formation of semantic memories, happen through the
retrieval of the associated temporal context.

However, two important and inter-related questions remain unclear for the
memory linking phenomenon:
\begin{inparaenum}[a)] \bfseries
\item whether and how the temporal order of the experiences affect the temporal
  window of memory linking.
\item whether and how negative emotional value of the experiences affect the
  temporal window of memory linking.
\end{inparaenum}
Regarding the first question, the excitability hypothesis would predict no
effect of temporal order, \textit{i.e.} a memory would link to a past memory
equally well as to a future memory, whereas temporal context model would predict
a stronger prospective memory linking, \textit{i.e.} a memory would share more
overlapping ensemble and have stronger association with the other memory that
happens later in time. Regarding the second question, the excitability
hypothesis would predict an effect of negative emotional value on prospective
memory linking, so that a memory that has a more negative value, comparing to a
neutral memory, would have a stronger association with memories in the future,
but not in the past. Meanwhile, the temporal context model would fail to provide
a prediction regarding the second question since emotional valence has not been
integrated into the model.

From a psychological perspective, these two questions are highly relevant to our
day-to-day experiences and thus important for the implication of memory linking,
since:
\begin{inparaenum}[a)]
\item relating a highly favorable/traumatic memory to other (potentially causal)
  experiences is more beneficial than relating a neutral memory to others, so
  that the animal may learn to engage/avoid the same highly significant
  experience in the future.
\item relating a memory to past experiences is more beneficial than relating a
  memory to future experiences, since only past experiences may have a causal
  role which is important to learn.
\end{inparaenum}
Moreover, answering these two questions may hint on the potential mechanism of
memory linking. It has been hypothesized that memory linking happens through
excitability mechanism, where the ensemble neurons of first memory sustain an
elevated excitability during the memory linking time window, and thus are more
likely to be recruited during the encoding of the second memory, facilitating
the linking of the two memory. If such hypothesis is true, we should expect an
unbiased memory linking, where neither the affective value of the second memory
nor the temporal order of the two memories would affect the time window of
memory linking. Such result would further support the time-stamping hypothesis,
and would suggest memory linking to be a result of constant spontaneous turn
over of ensemble. Alternatively, if the affective value or the temporal order of
the two memories has an effect on memory linking, it suggests a more top-down,
potentially learning guided mechanism may be responsible for memory linking.
Thus, the main goal of this proposal is to study the effect of affective value
and temporal order on memory linking. The results would extend our knowledge on
memory linking and more generally episodic memory.

In addition, the analysis of neural recording data in memory linking experiments
have been limited to comparing overlapping ensemble cells that are active during
recording sessions. Such analysis provided a simple estimation of
similarities between ensembles and successfully supported behavior data.
However, it reduces the time dimension of each recording session to a binary,
``active-or-not'' representation, precluding any analysis on the structure of
the ensemble within session. This limitation is mainly due to the task-free and
one-trial-learning nature of memory linking, where there is no task
variables to align the recording data to, nor is there enough time for place
cells to be formed and detected. Dimension reduction approaches, or more
specifically principal component analysis (PCA) is a very useful tool in such
circumstances, since it can transform higher dimension recording data to lower
dimension, temporally structured components in an unsupervised manner. Thus
another goal of the presented proposal is to apply PCA analysis to neural
recording data during memory linking experiments. Such analysis could uncover
the underlying structures of memory ensembles, and help us understand the nature
of memory linking on the ensemble level.
