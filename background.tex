\section*{A. Significance}

Understanding how temporally distinct memories can be related together is
essential to understanding episodic memory, since the ability to associate
different episodes across long periods of times is essential to forming memories
\cite{eichenbaum_hippocampus_1999}. It is generally believed that hippocampus
make an important contribution to episodic memories in rodents. Traditionally,
studies have focused on hippocampal coding within episodes, which are usually
testing sessions of a behavior task repeated across days. Most notably, we have
extensive knowledge of how space is coded in familiar settings
\cite{hartley_space_2014}, as well as how time is coded in well-learned
time-dependent tasks \cite{eichenbaum_time_2014}. On the other hand, it is found
that different population of hippocampal neurons are engaged in memories of
different contexts across days. Thus the population of neurons encoding a
specific memory is termed the ensemble of said memory, and it is found that
artificially stimulating an ensemble is sufficient to drive the retrieval of the
corresponding memory and elicit behavior response \cite{ramirez_creating_2013}.
Interestingly, it is found that ensembles of same familiar environments drift
across time, in that different population of neurons are recruited to encode the
same environment at different times. Moreover, the number of neurons that are
shared between two ensembles, or, the ``overlap'' between two ensembles, varies
in a time-dependent manner, so that the overlap of ensembles encoding memories
of the same environment is higher if the memories are separated with shorter
time interval \cite{rubin_hippocampal_2015}. However, it was unclear whether
overlaps of ensembles encoding different environments have a similar
time-dependent property, and whether such difference in overlaps have any
behavior correlates. If different ensembles of memories merely reflect the
difference in features, it would be surprising to find any time modulation of
the overlaps between memories encoding different environments.

Recently, it has been found in rodent hippocampus that the neuronal ensembles of
two distinct contextual memories separated by 5 hours time interval has more
overlapping cells than those separated by 2 days or 7 days. Interestingly,
subsequent fear conditioning in the later context induce elevated freezing level
in the former context when the two contexts are separated by 5 hours, indicating
a transfer of fear memory from the second context to the first. Such results
suggest a linking of two temporally distinct memories through overlapping
neuronal ensembles, and the phenomenon is termed memory linking
\cite{cai_shared_2016}. Following these findings, two models have been proposed
to explain the phenomenon of memory linking: On cellular and circuit level, It
has been hypothesized that memory linking happens through excitability
mechanism, where the ensemble neurons of first memory sustain an elevated
excitability during the memory linking time window, and thus are more likely to
be recruited during the encoding of the second memory, facilitating the linking
of the two memory \cite{kastellakis_linking_2016}; At the same time, from a
conceptual and computational aspect, temporal context model suggests that memory
linking is a peculiar case of a more general temporal context framework, which
argues that features of memories are associated with an ever-drifting temporal
context, and all recollection of episodic memories, as well as formation of
semantic memories, happen through the retrieval of the associated temporal
context \cite{howard_temporal_2005}.

However, various aspects of memory linking remain under-studied. Most notably,
it is unclear what factors affect the temporal window of memory linking, defined
as the maximum time interval within which two memories could be linked together.
Besides, the effect of temporal order on memory linking remains unclear - it has
been demonstrated that memory linking can happen retrospectively, in that the
fear associated with a later memory can transfer back to a neutral memory that
happened earlier. It is unknown, however, whether memory linking could happen
prospectively, where the fear associated with a memory can transfer forward to a
neutral memory that happens later in time. Moreover, if prospective memory
linking exists, it is interesting to see whether it has a same temporal window
as retrospective memory linking. Taken together, two important and inter-related
questions remain unclear for the memory linking phenomenon:
\begin{inparaenum}[a)] \bfseries
\item whether and how the temporal order of the experiences affect the temporal
  window of memory linking.
\item whether and how negative emotional valence of the experiences affect the
  retrospective temporal window of memory linking.
\end{inparaenum}
Regarding the first question, the excitability hypothesis would predict longer
memory linking window for prospective memory linking, since negative emotional
valence increase the excitability of neurons, making them sustain an elevated
excitability for longer period of time comparing to those engaged in neutral
memories, thus extend the time window where a negative memory could be linked to
a neutral memory in the future, but not in the past. Similarly, the temporal
context model would predict a stronger prospective memory linking as well.
Regarding the second question, the excitability hypothesis would not predict an
effect of negative emotional valence on retrospective memory linking, since the
excitability of neurons engaged in a neutral memory should not be affect by
emotional valence of a memory happens in the future. Meanwhile, the temporal
context model would fail to provide a prediction regarding the second question
since emotional valence has not been integrated into the model.

However, from a ethological perspective, the predictions regarding the two
questions would be different from those predicted by the two existing models.
Specifically:
\begin{inparaenum}[a)]
\item relating a memory to past experiences is more beneficial than relating a
  memory to future experiences, since only past experiences may have a causal
  role which is important to learn.
\item relating a highly traumatic memory to other experiences (especially past
  experiences) is more beneficial than relating a neutral memory to others, so
  that the animal may learn to avoid the same situation in the future.
\end{inparaenum}
An important example of such perspective is conditioned taste aversion, where
the animals learned to associate the negative experience (sickness) with a past
experience (consumption of food), and such association depends on the valence of
the negative valence (how much sickness was induced).

Thus, the main goal of this proposal is to study the effect of temporal order
and emotional valence on memory linking. The study would help us understand the
mechanism and behavioral significance of memory linking, and may extend our
knowledge on episodic memory in general.

In addition to behavior, it is important to see whether there is neural
correlates of memory linking in hippocampus. Traditionally, the analysis of
neural recording data in memory linking experiments have been limited to
comparing overlapping ensemble cells that are active during recording sessions.
Such analysis provided a simple estimation of similarities between ensembles and
successfully supported behavior data. However, it reduces the time dimension of
each recording session to a binary, ``active-or-not'' representation, precluding
any analysis on the structure of the ensemble within session. This limitation is
mainly due to the task-free and one-trial-learning nature of memory linking,
where there is no task variables to align the recording data to, nor is there
enough time for place cells to be formed and detected. Dimension reduction
approaches, or more specifically principal component analysis (PCA) is a very
useful tool in such circumstances, since it can transform higher dimension
recording data to lower dimension, temporally structured components in an
unsupervised manner. Thus another goal of the presented proposal is to apply PCA
analysis to neural recording data during memory linking experiments. Such
analysis could uncover the underlying structures of memory ensembles, and help
us understand the nature of memory linking on the ensemble level.
