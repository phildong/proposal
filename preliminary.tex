\subsection*{Retrospective memory linking window is longer than prospective
  linking window for a negative memory}

In the preliminary study shown in \autoref{fig:prelim_pro_retro}, animals were
put into two distinct contexts and separated into two major groups for which the
temporal order of the two contexts during encoding is opposite. In the
``prospective'' group, animals received a delayed shock in context B first, and
then explore context A, whereas in the ``retrospective'' group, animals explored
context A first, and then get a delayed shock in context B. Both groups were
tested in context A again 2 days after they are exposed to both context A and B.
Within each major group, the animals were further divided into subgroups in
which exposure to A and B were separated by varying intervals of time. Thus,
elevated freezing level in the context A, where no shock ever occurred for both
groups, indicates a transfer of fear and a linking of the two contexts.
Furthermore, comparison of freezing levels in context A between subgroups with
various time intervals can reveal the difference of temporal windows of memory
linking across ``prospective'' and ``retrospective'' groups. For all groups, the
exploration and testing session lasted for 5 minutes, a foot shock of 0.5 mA was
delivered at the beginning of the second minute. The various time intervals are
5 hours, 1 day, 2 days and 7 days for both groups.

In the ``prospective'' linking group, we observed significant higher freezing
level in context A with 5 hours interval relative to those with 7 day interval,
but not with either 1 day or 2 days interval. This suggest that the fear
memories were able to transfer forward to a neutral context 5 hours in the
future. On the other hand, in the ``retrospective'' linking group, we observed
higher freezing level with 5 hours, 1 day and 2 days interval compared to those
with 7 days interval. This suggests that fear memory was able to transfer
backward up to 2 days. Taken together, these results suggest an extended
temporal window of retrospective memory linking compared to prospective memory
linking.

\subsection*{Aversion increases ensemble overlap between the aversive and
  neutral contexts during memory retrieval}

%   \label{fig:prelim_val}
% \end{figure}

In the preliminary study shown in \autoref{fig:prelim_val}, the effect of
negative valence on the temporal window of retrospective memory linking was
studied. Briefly, animals were put into context A and B in that order and were
divided into two major groups --- ``neutral'' and ``aversive''. The difference
between the two major groups is that in the ``aversive'' group, the animals
received a delayed shock during the encoding session of context B, thus making
context B an aversive memory from the beginning. In contrast, for the
``neutral'' group, the emotional valence of context B was initially neutral, and
the animals received an immediate shock 2 days after the initial exploration of
context B. Similar to the preliminary experiments described earlier, animals
within each major group were further divided into subgroups according to
various time intervals between initial exposure of context A and B, while all of
the animals were put back to context A for testing and the comparison of
freezing levels in A between subgroups could reveal the difference in temporal
windows of memory linking across ``neutral'' and ``aversive'' groups. We
observed that consistent with published works, animals in the ``neutral'' group
can only link the two memories across 5 hours. However, animals in the
``aversive'' group can link the two memories across 2 days, suggesting an
extension of temporal window of memory linking due to emotional valence of the
initial context memory. Thus, we chose a temporal interval of 2 days for
following calcium imaging studies, since there was a significant difference in
behavior across the two groups with a 2 day time interval.

In the accompanying imaging study shown in \autoref{fig:prelim_val_imag}, the
animals were divided into two groups and undergo the same paradigm as described
above. The difference is that the time interval between context A and B is set
to 2 days for all animals, and that animals are tested in a novel context C in
addition to context A. Calcium imaging with miniature microscope was carried out
in all sessions, so that the neural ensemble of each session can be obtained and
comparisons of ensembles can be carried out within subject. Specifically, we
looked at the overlap between two ensembles, which is the number of neurons that
were active in both sessions as a proportion of the total number of neurons that
were active in either sessions. Consistent with behavioral results, during
retrieval, we observed a significant increase in the overlap between ensembles
of context A and B in the ``aversive'' group, but not in the ``neutral'' group.
Moreover, no difference was observed between the two groups for the ensemble
overlaps involving the novel context C, \textit{i.e.} the ensemble overlaps
between context A and C or between context B and C, confirming that the increase
in ensemble overlap between context A and B is a specific neural correlate for
memory linking. Surprisingly, no difference in ensemble overlap between context
A and B was observed across the two groups in encoding sessions. Such a result
suggests that the increase in ensemble overlap, which is hypothesized to drive
memory linking, emerges after encoding, which is contrary to what would be
predicted by the memory excitability hypothesis.

\subsection*{Minian: a python analysis pipeline for calcium imaging data}

To address the difficulties raised during the analysis of calcium imaging data
with miniature microscopes, we have developed an open--source analysis pipeline
that allows the user to easily run through code, take notes and visualize the
results at the same time. Specifically, the pipeline incorporates
pre--processing steps that take raw videos as inputs, and corrects various
artifacts that are usually seen with miniature microscopes. For instance, the
motion correction step for miniature microscope is usually hindered by a ``dark
ring'' around the field--of--view caused by vignetting, ``bright spots'' caused
by dust on the lens or sensor, and a noise pattern that is stable across time.
We apply various interpolation and smoothing steps to specifically remove such
artifacts before motion correction, and the result of motion correction is
improved. The results from each step, including motion correction, can be
visualized as dynamically--generated animations (\textit{i.e.} without saving
intermediate videos to hard drives). Thus the user can easily visualize the
effect of pre--processing steps and decide whether each step is necessary for
the specific data. Regarding the result of the CNMF algorithm, there are two
major concerns about the quality of the extraction of calcium traces:
\begin{inparaenum}[a)]
\item the algorithm usually picks up ``units'' around the border of the
  field--of--view that are actually noise.
\item the balance between ``demixing'', where overlapping neurons are separated
  and treated as individual neurons, and ``merging'', where spatially scattered
  fluorescent signals coming from the same neuron are treated as single source,
  can be very sensitive to parameter tweaking, and it is often the case that
  signals coming from one neuron are falsely treated as separated neurons, or
  vice versa.
\end{inparaenum}

% \end{figure}
Thus, the pipeline also provides visualization tools to address these issues.
Specifically, the tools provide an overlaid contour plot of the spatial
footprints of all identified ``units'' within a session, thus the shape of each
``unit'' can be easily inspected. Moreover, the user can directly select
``units'' of interest from the overlaid contour plots, and the calcium traces of
selected ``units'' can be visualized in a manner that is similar to the plot of
spike trains of different neurons. Thus, the user can easily inspect whether
``units'' that are overlapping or close to each other have correlated calcium
traces that suggest a single source of signal. Furthermore, there is an option
to manually accept or reject ``units'' within the visualization tool, so that
the results can be refined and false ``units'' can be taken out easily without
leaving the visualization. All these features help the user to detect and
correct the potential pitfalls of the calcium signal extraction process.
